# Matrix

Q1)  Gived a NxM 2D matrix, rearrange such that Each diagonal in the lower left triangle of the rectangular grid is sorted in ascending order. Each diagonal in the      upper right triangle of the rectangular grid is sorted in descending order. The major diagonal in the grid starting from the top-left corner is not rearranged. 

Q2)  Given a matrix of size r*c. Traverse the matrix in spiral form.

Q3)  Given a boolean matrix of size RxC where each cell contains either 0 or 1, modify it such that if a matrix cell matrix[i][j] is 1 then all the cells in its ith      row and jth column will become 1.

Q4)  Given a square matrix[][] of size N x N. The task is to rotate it by 90 degrees in an anti-clockwise direction without using any extra space.

Q5)  Given a matrix of size n x m, where every row and column is sorted in increasing order, and a number x. Find whether element x is present in the matrix or not.

Q6)  Given a boolean 2D array of n x m dimensions where each row is sorted. Find the 0-based index of the first row that has the maximum number of 1's.
